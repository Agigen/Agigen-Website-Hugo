    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        This digital adaption of the game of tag surrounds a virtual MINI car. The game challenges you to hunt, catch and escape with a virtual MINI using a smartphone app.

        To catch the car, you have to get within 50m of the virtual MINI and press “Take The MINI Now” in the app and then escape as fast as possible, because anyone else who gets within 50m of you can instantly take the virtual MINI back. If you are the person holding the virtual MINI after 7 days of 24/7 gaming, you’ll win a real car.

    <h2>What we've done</h2>
    <p>
        We took care of all the backend work, as well as an interface for the people handling the competition. This was one of our earliest campaigns built on Google App Engine, and we learned a lot about some more or less common pitfalls.<br>
        We also took care of a lot of anti-cheat mechanisms as there were a lot of people trying to manipulate the game to win the car.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our backend work was used for the campaign in Tokyo and Copenhagen.

    <p>
        This campaign won a lot of awards, and we made a name for ourselves as a premium backend partner for ad agencies looking for scalability.
