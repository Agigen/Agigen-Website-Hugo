                Migros, Switzerland’s largest retail store chain, holds a yearly campaign called the Mania. Previous years have included Mountain Mania, Domino Mania and Captor Mania.
                Every Mania has been about collecting something and involved both an offline and an online element.
                Suisse Mania revolves around collecting places of importance to Switzerland, for example mountains like Matterhorn, the CERN research facility and chocolate factories.

                    The offline collecting of items works like a Happy Meal at McDonalds. Shop for at least 20 CHF in a Migros store and you’ll get a plastic model with every purchase.
                    Online it’s up to you to find all of the 50 objects hidden around Switzerland by playing around in the 3D world.

    <h2>Models & Textures</h2>
    <p>
        Suisse Mania includes 50 main objects, 4 joker objects and countless environmental objects such as trees, streets and animals scattered throughout Switzerland. The modelling and texturing was a big part of the whole production.
    </p>

    <h2>Breaking ground</h2>
    <p>
        One of the first tasks were to create a mesh of the Switzerland topography. To make sure the world was performant enough we had to try to keep the polygon count as low as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Suisse Landscape & Culture</h2>
    <p>
        The designers spent countless hours researching the different aspects of the Swiss landscape. In a country covered by the Alps, large forests, wine districts and both old and new ciites it was crucial to capture that unique feeling of each and every one of them.

            This was our first larger project using the Goo Create engine to power the experience. We’ve previously been working mostly with Three.js, but with Goo we got a whole new workflow with easier prototyping and deployments.

            It’s a game for kids! Throughout our concept and design phase we had to make sure the game and UI was appealing and easy to use for kids. By using icons and large buttons we made it accessible and easy to use on both computers and mobile devices.
