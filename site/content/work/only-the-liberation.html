    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        ONLY needed a new and viral way of showcasing their latest collection. The solution was an online movie called The Liberation that also contained an interactive shopping experience.<br>
        Anytime during the movie the user could hit pause, and the frame freezes. You can then click on every item of clothing worn by the characters, to browse, like, pin, tweet and buy.
    </p>

<section class="work__section container container--tight">
    <h2>What we've done</h2>
    <p>
        We built the backend and took care of hosting and assets. The backend handled different regions, and the gamification part with the algorithms for calculating if a visitor was a winner, depending on the region, jeans available and such.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also took care of the forms and validations that the user got to fill in if he or she was one of the lucky ones who got a pair of jeans.
