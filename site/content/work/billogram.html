<h2>tl;dr:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Project for Billogram</li>
    <li>An online service aimed at smaller Swedish companies, making invoicing easier and helping the companies save time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    We helped the startup Billogram to develop the first version of their online invoice service. The service was meant to make invoicing easier; with easy overview of what's been paid, what is still pending and which invoices are overdue.
</p>
<p>
    Automatic reminders for overdue payments and built-in escalation to collectors enables the customer to invoice once and then let the system take care of the rest.
</p>
<h2>What have we done?(!)</h2>
<p>
    We provided technical expertise and actual programming, basically becoming Billogram's tech department. Development spanned over about two years, during which the first prototypes and betas were developed.
</p>
<p>
    Integrations with the Swedish Central Banking System and applying all the legal regulations to invoicing provided technical challenges
</p>

<h2>Afterwards</h2>
<p>
    In late 2013 Billogram aquired the programmers that had been working on the service and are now on their way to expand into other countries.
