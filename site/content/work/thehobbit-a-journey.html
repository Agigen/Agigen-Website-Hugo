    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        There are quite a few fantasy geeks at our office, and even those not particularly interested will still get their asses to the cinemas when there's a Tolkien film goin up. Imagine our delight at being part of this interactive experience in Middle-Earth, once again partnering up with North Kingdom to create some magic.

    <h2>What have we done?(!)</h2>
    <p>
        We didn't get to do any of the really cool stuff on this project; our efforts were more in the obscure though challenging nonetheless. The application was to be localized in 43 languages so we decided to create an entire tool solely for translations. It imports and exports json files connecting a key to an element in the HTML. There is also a UI to edit the strings without the fuss of json-files, but as far as we know it was never used by Google (who were in charge of actually providing the translations). It turned out rather well and we have reused it in other applications as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were also in charge of setting upp the application's hosting on Google App Engine and managing staging versions and deploys.

        It won awards. NK has a knack for making that type of site.
