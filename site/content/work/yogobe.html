    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Start up company Yogobe wanted to create an online service which provided subscriptions of yoga instructions and training programs for a monthly fee.

<section class="container container--tight work__section">
    <h2>What we have done</h2>
    <p>
        The service is basically a youtube for yoga videos. We had to work a lot with different user roles and access rights to different content, since depending on the type of subscription the user would have access to different content. Integration with payment systems and of course an easy to understand CMS for the instructors to upload their new content were also a big part of the development.

    <h2>Afterwards</h2>
    <p>
        Continued development has been handled by a freelancer, and the service has expanded to Norway and Finland as well.
