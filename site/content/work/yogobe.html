    <h2>What we have done</h2>
    <p>
        The service is basically a Netflix for yoga videos. We had to work a lot with different user roles and access rights to different content, since depending on the type of subscription the user would have access to different content. Integration with payment systems and of course an easy to understand CMS for the instructors to upload their new content were also a big part of the development.
