            Our nifty little easter-egg chat on the start page caused<br>
             a lot of interest, and we met some new friends.

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        When we built this version of agigen.se we were just starting to use the hyped collaboration tool <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold">Slack</a>. We got hooked when we noticed how much it resembled IRC-style channels, and together with apps for all the platforms we use it became a knock-out victory over Skype that we had used in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
        Their API provided some fun ways to integrate with Slack. We played around a bit with some different approaches, and came up with the idea that we could have a retro styled chat on our start page, where you could connect to one of our Slack channels.

        When we launced we even got noticed by <a href="https://twitter.com/slackhq" target="_blank">Slack on twitter</a>, who tweeted about us, exposing us to Slack's 54 000 followers.

    <h2>The exposure</h2>

    <p>
        Since the launch until todays date (from october 2014 until january 2015) people from more than fifty countries have joined our channel. We've recieved praise, hate, and a lot of random fun converstations during work. The only problem we've had is that there are people connecting from different time zones when we're not available to answer.<br>
        We have also had some regulars who have been visiting the chat from time to time, and one of them; <strong>Egor</strong> has always made us laugh with his amazing photoshop skills and stories from Ukraine.

    <h2>Some more features</h2>

    <p>
        And btw, have you noticed that there are even more features hidden in the pseudo-unix-like "shell"? Hint; start with <code>ls</code> and take it from there.
