        <h2>
            Our nifty little easter-egg chat on the start page caused a lot of interest, and we met some new friends.

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        When we built this version of agigen.se we were just starting using <a href="#">Slack</a>, the hyped collaboration tool. We got hooked when we noticed how much it resembled IRC-style channels, and together with apps for all the platforms we use it became a knock-out victory over Skype that we had used in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
        Their API provided some fun ways to integrate with Slack. We played around a bit with some different approaches, and came up with the idea that we could have a retro styled chat on our start page, where you could connect to one of our Slack channels.

    <h2>The exposure</h2>

    <p>
        Since the launch until todays date (from october 2014 until january 2015) people from more than fifty countries have joined our channel. We've recieved praise, hate, and a lot of random fun converstations during work. The only problem we've had is that there are people connecting from different time zones when we're not available to answer.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we launced we even got noticed by <a href="https://twitter.com/slackhq">Slack on twitter</a>, who tweeted about us, leading to exposure from Slacks 54 000 followers.

    <h2>Our new friends</h2>

    <p>
        We have also have some regulars that have been visiting the chat from time to time, and one of them; Egor have always made us laugh with his amazing photoshop skills and stories from Ukraine.

    <h2>Some more features</h2>

    <p>
        And btw, have you noticed that there are even more featured hidden in the pseudo-unix-like "shell"? Hint; start with <em>ls</em> and take it from there.
