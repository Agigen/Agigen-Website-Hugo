    When McDonalds released their new McWrap we got to work with Apegroup and DDB on the campaign. The tagline for the campaign was "Too good to put down" and the app revolved around that concept. The user had to keep a finger pointed at the screen while getting to the closest McDonalds, to upon arrival be rewarded with a free McWrap.

    <h2>International adaptions</h2>
    <p>
        After the success with Go&Get for McWrap in Sweden an international release wasn't far behind. The same concept were used in Norway but with free coffee instead of wraps.
