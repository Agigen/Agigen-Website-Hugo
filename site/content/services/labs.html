                        Open source is a good thing! We try to encourage our clients to release their source code, with varying success. On our page over at Github you can check out some of our code that we reuse, or have released to the public.
                        Even this site is open source, and built using <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/">Hugo</a> - check it out!

            <p>We built a facebook app controlled puck shooting machine for Sweden Hockey Games.</p>
            <p>Using an iPad on location the crowd got to shoot hockey pucks at a live goalie. We built the web interface, server infrastructure and the robotic engine controlling the puck-shooter.</p>
