Vodafone Bufferbusters is a mobile agumented reality game that took place in Germany. The mission was to capture all the Buffer monsters that floats around and makes the internet slow and laggy.

The buffer monsters are small, sneaky creatures that aren't visible for the naked eye, but they are all around us and makes the internet slow. That's why we need to work together and catch 'em all using our smartphones in a Ghost Busters vacuumer-likely manner.

The project was created together with North Kingdom and Monterosa.

Agigen took care of the backend and hosting, and the backend was built using Python and ran on Google App Engine. In total there was about 1,5 million Buffer monsters placed all over Germany.
