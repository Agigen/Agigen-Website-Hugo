<h2>tl;dr:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Project for Kuratorskonventet</li>
    <li>Kuratorskonventet's site for students in Uppsala. It's a portal to different student nations, their activities and the housings they offer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    A couple of the student nations in Uppsala joined forces to produce a common site where new students easily could read about how to sign up for new housing as well as actually register at the nations and sign up for housing. Being former students in Uppsala ourselves, with intimate knowledge of the pen and paper approach many nations used, it was a fun and challenging project to help them enter the digital era.
</p>
<h2>What have we done?(!)</h2>
<p>
    We created front- and backend for the project. Design was provided by an external agency. It was technically challenging because so many of the nations had different rules regulating who could apply for what type of accomodation. They also wanted to be able to edit the site's content quite a lot which was why we had to create quite an extensive admin, covering both handling members at the nations, the queues to the housings and the content of the site.
</p>
<p>
    As uppsalastudent became a well used tool, some of the other nations also wanted to add their housings to the system, which led to additional development in the summer of 2013.
</p>

<h2>Afterwards</h2>
<p>
    Being one of our earliest projects, there are of course things we've learned along the way that had we the time and budget we'd change in uppsalastudent. We're still maintaining the system and it's working satisfactorily, but there are no major changes planned for the forseeable future, so we'll see if we get a chance to update it someday.
