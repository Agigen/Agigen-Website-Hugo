            <h2>Release early</h2>
            <p>
               Usually when we're involved in a completly new product we aim to create a MVP - a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a>.
               The MVP is a product that you can release to your customers and start testing if your product, business model and concept on real people.
