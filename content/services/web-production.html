        <p>
            Do you have an idea but you're not sure if it's even possible to realize? These are the projects where we excel. We'll consider your idea; how to make it real and even better, then offer you a budget and a time plan.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want, we'll do UX and concept design together with you or if you'd rather we just produce, we'll turn your designs to code. Striving to make the best of everything we'll make suggestions on potential improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
            During production, we keep in close contact with you; keeping everyone up to speed. When changes are requested we reconsider design and user experience, which makes design as much part of our production as coding is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tweaking and testing is a constant part of our process, but as the project nears the finish line we of course invest extra into those efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
            We love it when we have some time left over to lavish affection on a product; fitting it with that extra polish and flair.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last step: release. Bring out the champagne, kick off your shoes and enjoy the happy faces.
