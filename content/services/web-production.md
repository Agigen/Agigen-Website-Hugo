A typical case
==============

A customer gets in touch about their new project. Usually with a rough time plan and budget. We then give them our feedback and suggestions.

Then the production starts. During this time we have regular talks with our client to ensure that we're on the correct path.

During the last part of the project we usually move into testing and tweaking.
