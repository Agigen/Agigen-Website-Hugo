        <h2 class="alpha">Case A-Z: Working with us explained</h2>

        <p>
        Do you have an idea but you're not exactly sure if it's even possible to achieve? These are the projects where we excel. We'll consider your idea; how to make it real, what could be improved upon and then offer you a budget and a time plan.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you want, we'll lend you our experience in UX and concept design and together with you create the blueprints of the product. If you'd rather we just produce, we'll take your finished designs and put them to production. Never ones to keep quiet, we'll still probably make suggestions on perceived improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
        During our actual production, we make sure to keep in close contact with you, to ensure we're all on the same page. We'll always consider the benefit of a feature versus the time frame together with you to keep the project on time and within budget. The agile approach demands that we rethink design and user experience to accomodate changes made to the product. Design is as much part of our production as producing code is. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Tweaking and testing is a constant part of our process, but as the project nears the finish line we of course invest extra into those efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
        We love it when we have some time left over to lavish affection on a product. It provides for a product with that extra polish and flair.
        </p>

        <p>
        Last step: release. Bring out the champagne, kick off your shoes and enjoy the happy smiles.
