        <h2 class="alpha">A typical case</h2>

        <p>
        A customer gets in touch about their new project. Usually with a rough time plan and budget. We then give them our feedback and suggestions.
        </p>

        <p>
        Then the production starts. During this time we have regular talks with our client to ensure that we're on the correct path.
        </p>


        <p>During the last part of the project we usually move into testing and tweaking.</p>
